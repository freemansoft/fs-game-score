# Where did these rules come from?

- [Flutter AI rules docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/ai-rules)
- [Copilot Custom Instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-instructions)
- [rules.md on github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flutter/flutter/refs/heads/main/docs/rules/rules.md)

## Changes

- Linting rules changed from default to use VGV linter
- Use `riverpod` instead of `provider`
- Added **Semantic Label Keys** rule
